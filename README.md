# Matador: A Bitcoin-Powered Passthrough Service

Matador lets you sell API access against an arbitrary API using your API Key in exchange for Bitcoin micropayments. 

I built Matador because I'm sick of waiting for companies to wrap their APIs with Bitcoin payments, so this lets anyone with an API Key act as an 402 passthrough to the actual API, letting anyone pay for using your API Key with bitcoin.

Matador currently supports the following APIs. To use them, you simply change the server_root_url to the corresponding matador_url and hit it exactly as you would

```bash
OpenAI: api.openai.com -> matador_url/openai
ClipDrop: cipdrop-api.co -> matador_url/clipdrop
Palm: generativelanguage.googleapis.com -> matador_url/palm
Replicate: api.replicate.com -> matador_url/replicate
Anthropic: api.anthropic.com -> matador_url/anthropic
Stability: api.stabiliy.ai -> matador_url/stability
Goose: api.goose.ai -> matador_url/goose
Cohere: api.cohere.ai -> matador_url/cohere
AI21: api.ai21.com -> matador_url/ai21
Replit Modelfarm: production-modelfarm.replit.com -> matador_url/replit
```

You can try it out by hitting exactly like you would hit against `https://api.openai.com` but without the OpenAI Authentication Header:

```bash
curl -k -v http://localhost:8080/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

This will return an L402 token and invoice, the invoice is quoted for the previous request's parameters (method, path, body).

```bash
Www-Authenticate: L402 "token=48IUkiWUzeeHsmV-fIhHBdRoeMDVEfc5WLFhYRRE_zJwYXltZW50SGFzaD04MTk1Y2YxOWJkNmQ0YTIxZTY5ZTJjYThhMmE4YTIyZGY3NjdiYTVmMzc0MmVkNmE5Njk5OTI0NWZiYTIyZjcxJnJlcXVlc3RIYXNoPWFlN2Q3ZTU0MzIzNTgzNzRmODZmNjAxZmYzYzljOTFlZTRlMWZjYjAyZTViNmU5OThkMmU1OWUzMzYzYzIwYmE, invoice=lnbc80n1pj2udc5pp5sx2u7xdad49zre579j52929z9hmk0wjlxapw665knxfyt7az9acshp56kymqtxr5es99pd82vjjnmssr2l72l379pv87d05c5pd4s2n0ysqcqzzsxqyz5vqsp50per6u35xrl3uh0ak7q0qql3mvr0ep2kr04p7d4mkgjdfnv9cw6q9qyyssqp7pvnssphg9dgh35l35jlwtpcy7lvleuqjv4u7jmczu4umnc9mukcxdq9p0n3eg4a2ezfqlux7kc47qkdp9q30cvdrkcgunr4pcnlusqh8m5e0
```

Pay the lightning invoice to get the preimage and retry the same request with the L402 authorization header:

```bash
curl -k -v http://localhost:8080/openai/v1/chat/completions   \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: L402 48IUkiWUzeeHsmV-fIhHBdRoeMDVEfc5WLFhYRRE_zJwYXltZW50SGFzaD04MTk1Y2YxOWJkNmQ0YTIxZTY5ZTJjYThhMmE4YTIyZGY3NjdiYTVmMzc0MmVkNmE5Njk5OTI0NWZiYTIyZjcxJnJlcXVlc3RIYXNoPWFlN2Q3ZTU0MzIzNTgzNzRmODZmNjAxZmYzYzljOTFlZTRlMWZjYjAyZTViNmU5OThkMmU1OWUzMzYzYzIwYmE:7660c22f7e59fba0bfce676f666bc0bb81286e8594028c7d4f8715b7d8e48297"  \
-d '{                            
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

And you'll get the standard API response from the service you're hitting against.

Olé!! You just paid bitcoin to hit the API.

Matador passes the request through exactly as if you were hitting against the actual API, replacing the L402 Authorization Header the client hits against matador with your API key. Clients pay you in Bitcoin, you pay the API service with your credit card.

## Getting Started

Here's how to get Matador up and running

### Prerequisites

You need to have Rust installed: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Or just load this into Replit, the default configs from the checked in .replit and replit.nix work out of the box

### Clone the repository

To clone the Matador repository to your local system, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kodylow/matador-rs
```

### Configuration

Post-cloning, navigate to the project root and create a .env file (or on Replit set these in Secrets). This file must include your API key, the API root, your Lightning address, and a Rune secret as follows:

```dotenv
API_KEY = YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
API_ROOT = "https://api.openai.com"
LN_ADDRESS = "yourusername@getalby.com"
RUNE_SECRET = "some-base65-secret-bytes-as-hex"
```

To generate the rune secret you just need some random base64 bytes, you can use this command:

```
openssl rand -base64 32
```

You can change the pricing and endpoints as well, the current configuration is extremely conservative (will overcharge in bitcoin terms) and hardcodes a price of bitcoin at $28,000 until I get around to creating a bitcoin price service.

# Running Matador

To launch the server, execute the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

Olé! Your Matador server is now live, ready to process requests and exchange API key access for Bitcoin payments.
